create Service:
- extends AbstractService
- PUBLIC constructor needed
- To access the AppContext you have to be inside a task called by TransactionScheduler using some identity:
  1)IdentityImpl owner = new SystemIdentity("app:" + appName);
  2)transactionScheduler.runTask(new KernelRunnable() {...})
